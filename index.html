      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <h3>Chad Beibide</h3>
        <div id="aboutMeFirst">
         <p><img src="img/homepage/headshot_2.JPG" alt="Chad Beibide Headshot" width="200">Well, my name is Chad Beibide, and welcome to my webpage! I am a passionate engineer, holding a Bachelors Degree in Wireless Engineering from Auburn University, where I graduated with a minor in computer science in 2022. I am originally from Huntsville, Alabama but have since moved out west to Dallas, Texas to continue pursuing opportunities to learn and dive deep into new fields. This latest adventure has led me to begin a career in 4G and 5G telecommunication systems and explore just how the phones that we all use are able to seamlessly connect to the network of towers and antennas around us. The longer I spend in the field, the more in awe I am that this complex system is able to work so well for so many people.</p>
         <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by technology and its interworking in our lives. From growing up as the family tech help desk, to taking every coding class available in high school and publishing an app, and later studying Wireless Engineering in college I have maintained a passion for learning, creating, and contributing to society through my passions and gifts. As I dove deeper into a passion for technology, I began to become more interested in not only how it works, but what its proper place in our lives looks like. It seemed that I could point out more and more examples of manipulative technology practices than I could point out truly uplifting ones. In studying and working in tech related fields, I aim to be part of the solution and not the problem. </p>
         <p>Hopefully this page lets you get to know me and what I'm about a little bit better. Do explore around and don't hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
         <p><i>God Bless and War Eagle!</i></p>
        </div>
      <h3>How I Spend My Free Time</h3>
        <p>When I have a free weekend, my favorite way to spend it is to throw the dog in the car, put the REI membership to use, and hike a new trail. I’ve also been known to do throw gear into a pack and tie up a tent for a backpacking trip. I’d say that I would take the mountains over the beach 8 out of 10 times. </p>
        <p>Through the week I enjoy tinkering with small projects, 3D printers, running, coffee, baking, and binging more YouTube than I probably should. Staying involved in my Catholic parish keeps me grounded and centered on what is most important, only helping guide my passions in all other areas of life.</p>
        <h3>Why a Webpage?</h3>
        <p>The information that a single-page resume provides is not enough. This page provides me a way to simultaneously deliver a more in-depth story, dive into web development, and give me a project that I can keep updating as new paths unfold in my life and career. Plus, I think its pretty cool…</p>

    <section id="Involvement">
      <h2>Involvement</h2>

      <h3>Clubs and Organizations</h3>
      <div id="cso">
		    <h4>President | Auburn University Catholic Student Organization</h4>
          <p><img src="img/homepage/aucatholic.jpg" alt="AU Catholic Logo" width="150">I served as the President of the Catholic Student Organization during the 2020 calendar year and aided in the behind-the-scenes planning, execution, and volunteering for events that are put on for a community of 300+ members.  In coming to Auburn, I knew I needed to find a strong faith community. I was active in my local youth group all four years high school and was excited to begin the next chapter. Here, I was able to find a great community to keep me accountable and challenge me to serve the Lord better through my studies, friendship, and interior life. This led me to step into a leadership role to make sure that the organization continues to operate smoothly and can be a safe place for all to enjoy and grow.</p>
            </div>
        <div id="band">
        <h4>Member | Auburn University Marching Band</h4>
            <p><img src="img/homepage/flash.jpg" alt="In Uniform with Cymbals" width="400">I have been part of a band program since I was in the 6th grade. Nine years later, I am still loving the activity. Music and band have brought me many highs, lows, awards, friends, and incredible opportunities. The first time I marched with the Auburn University Marching Band is shown at the top of this page: the 2018 Chick-Fil-A Kickoff in Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Aside from incredibly unique opportunities, band teaches time management, teamwork, responsibility, personal accountability, dependability, and work ethic.  The skills have helped to develop healthy study habits, a drive to achieve my best, a positive and uplifting attitude, and a commitment to the community around me. I would not trade the three seasons I marched with the Auburn University Marching Band for anything!</p>
        </div>
      <h3>Volunteering</h3>
        <p>Much of my volunteer work flows from my involvement in my local church. I am a Core Team member of St. Michael's CYO (Catholic Youth Organization) in Auburn, AL. Here, the core team aims to lead high schoolers as they walk in their faith, not only by educating, but through fellowship. I can truly say that being a part of this group has been one of my highest honors. Helping to equip these teens with practical insight, information, and experience has proven to be an invaluable investment. This has also taught me numerous things about myself and constantly drives me to become better each day.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <h3>Full Time</h3>
        <div id="position_detail">
          <h4>4G/5G System Structure Design Engineer | Samsung Electronics America | July 2022 - Present</h4>
            <p><img src="img/homepage/samsung.svg" width="200">Upon graduation, I accepted a return offer with Samsung Networks to support their cellular infrastructure deployments. As part of the FOA team (First Office Application) at Samsung, I validated the functionality of new baseband and call processing software features to ensure that they aligned with the intended design and no other KPIs are degraded as a result. This has been a tremendous learning opportunity in being able to learn just how devices are able to communicate with the alrger Radio Access Network through 4G and 5G technologies. I see this as one of the best positions for me to step into right after graduation, as I get to truly learn the telecom world from the inside. Blending in brand new features with existing standards has proven to be an incredibly unique opportunity to have access to at this level in my career. During my time at Samung, I have helped to drive 5 separate software loads to full acceptance in Verizon's network.</p>

      <h3>Internships</h3>
      <div id="position_detail">
        <h4>4G/5G System Structure Design Intern | Samsung Electronics America</h4>
          <p><img src="img/homepage/samsung.svg" alt="Samsung Electronics America Logo" width="200">For the summer of 2021, I had the incredible opportunity to join Samsung Electronics America in their Networks division to learn about all of the innovative work that Samsung does to continue innovating the 4G/5G radio access network. During my time here, I studied and presented user equipment device log messaging exchanges and KPI performance analysis. Diving right into the telecom industry certainly provided a unique challenge through learning an endless number of acronyms, protocols, layers, and 3GPP standards. During this period, it was vital to stay organized and keep an open line of communication with the talented individuals around me. I also had the opportunity to partake in a multi-talented team of 4 other interns from across the company, to present new ideas to executives as to how the unique ecosystem that Samsung offers can better be communicated to customers, thus helping to drive sales across nearly all product categories. </p>

      <h4>Mobile Solutions Intern | Hexagon PPM</h4>
        <p><img src="img/homepage/hexagon.svg" alt="Hesagon PPM logo" width="300">During the summer of 2020, I was fortunate to be able to remotely intern for Hexagon PPM in Madison, AL. My team was in charge of the configuration, QA, deployment, and support of mobile applications developed using an internal framework. In working with this team, I headed efforts to bring a new mobile application into the team's scope. Much of the configuration was already completed, which allowed me to push forward to prepare the product for customers. I created and executed an in-depth QA script for testing all aspects of the functionality that was specific to this new application. In doing so, many "showstopper" issues were identified. With each issue, documenting reports were filed and communicated to different development teams so that progress could continue to be made. Hexagon PPM operates under an Agile/Scrum methodology. With daily stand-ups and an up-to-date backlog and task board of items, tasks were able to be systematically carried out. Throughout my internship, I was responsible for communicating across several different teams located around the world to work towards resolving issues. In doing so, I refined my abilities in effective cross-functional communication.</p>

          During my senior year of high school, I interned with the Madison City Schools Central Office. Due to my background in programming, I was excited utilize these skills in a professional setting. Here, I re-developed the Madison City Schools mobile application, MCS GO. This involved a full re-write of the existing limited functionality app. I was tasked to redesign and bring new features such as push notifications, a curriculum catalog, and enhanced navigation. This was entirely self-led as there was nobody in the office with app development experience. Throughout the 7 months that I worked on this project, I taught myself development tools such as Xcode, Android Studio, Swift, Kotlin, SQL, Google Firebase, and much more. It was not rare that I would be staying extra hours at the office or working from home. Every new piece was a new avenue to explore and more research for me to do. Extensive troubleshooting was carried out after countless errors. Shoutout to Stack Overflow on this one, couldn't have done it without you!</p>

      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <div id="project">
        <h4>Ongoing | 8-bit Breadboard Computer</h4>
        <p><img src="img/homepage/breadboard3.jpg" alt="Breadboard Computer" width="500">This one has been a LOT of fun. This project springs from a well-known YouTuber, <a href="http://www.eater.net">Ben Eater</a>. He supplies part kits and tutorials, explaining every connection along the way. I began this project during the summer of 2020 after I completed a Computer Systems course. This project takes me deeper into the digital logic architecture of computers, along with invaluable troubleshooting and logical thinking experience. I currently have constructed the ALU, a-register, b-register, and clock module. There are several components left to tackle, such as the program counter, completion of the RAM module, control logic, and readout displays. This build is meant to be as transparent as possible. Each module has LED readouts that dynamically display the contents in BCD format. This helps greatly in troubleshooting connections and as a tool in understanding the transfer of data in every calculation. When done, the unit will be a full programmable 8-bit computer.</p>

        <h4>Raspberry PI Parking Sensor</h4>
        <p>This was among my first electronics projects. Completed in 2018 and winning First Place in the regional ACTE Technology fair, I learned a lot from it. From interfacing with I/O devices and pins to writing python scripts, this project incorporated many exciting aspects of engineering and design. The idea started simple and quickly became larger and larger as I learned the capabilities that the Raspberry Pi had to offer. When all was said and done, the finished product included an ultrasonic distance sensor, multi-color LED lighting strip, and LED matrix display. As a high schooler at the time, this project was entirely self-taught. Research into MOSFETs, LED voltage ratings, and existing libraries all slowly began to come together with some jumper wires and a breadboard. I will never forget the first time that I was able to activate the LED strip. After hours of troubleshooting code and wiring, the strip came to life in the early hours of the morning. The rest was history.</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <div id="project">
        <h4>You're Looking At It!</h4>
        <p>Surprise! This website has been a lot of fun in of itself in creating! Everything that you see here is 100% researched, designed, and created by me (aside from a few libraries). HTML and CSS have a special little place in my coding history. They were among the first languages I began learning when I stumbled across Codeademy in middle school. I still have relatively low experience in these fields but this project was largely carried out because I was determined to create something using this foreign format. All of the necessary information is out there, I just needed to sit down and learn it. Then all of a sudden... I have a website! Creating the original layout and figuring out the color scheme were largely among the hardest parts. In order to get specific functionality such as the navigation bar, and the floating action button, I decided to utilize JavaScript. After looking into this a little deeper I technically settled primarily with JQuery. With my background in many other languages, the actual coding of it was not difficult to pick up at all, and I look forward to supporting other projects that I begin in the future with some form of networking capabilities!
